## Notes:

I did not cared about making it mobile responsive at all; itvwasn't required.

I used inline CSS sometime; just because it is faster. I wouldn't do that at job, at least if not neccesar for the code logic.

The UI can be much better for sure; I did it like this but I could do it better if required.
